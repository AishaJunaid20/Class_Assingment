### 🧳 Mood-Based Travel Suggestion Agent

This is a simple chatbot built using **Python**, **Chainlit**, **uvicorn**, and **Gemini API** that suggests a travel destination based on the user's current mood.

### 💡 How It Works

* The user types how they are feeling (e.g., "I'm tired", "I'm feeling adventurous").
* The agent understands the mood.
* If the mood is **adventurous, tired, sad, happy, stressed**, it suggests a travel activity and destination.
* If the mood is not recognized, it asks the user to say it again more clearly.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Gemini 1.5 Pro API 🔑
* Chainlit (for building the UI) 💬
* Uvicorn (to run the app)
